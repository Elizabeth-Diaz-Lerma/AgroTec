Within this project, the creation of a greenhouse with a humidity and temperature sensor connected to a database was carried out. Where it is shown how the temperature and humidity are in real time through the connection to the mosquito system. In addition to this, a plate was added which generates sunlight to give the plants what they need and a pump with which it can be watered.
